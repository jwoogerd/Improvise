An implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe.
Try playing against the minimax algorithm by running in GHCi:

>>> playTicTacToe

Valid moves are the integers [0..8], where each integer names square of
the board, starting in the upper left and proceeding in the order that 
you would read a book.  The named square must be empty.
