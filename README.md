####Improvise: Modeling Musical Improvisation with Game Theory

Caroline Marcks, Andrew Mendelsohn, and Jayme Woogerd

Advised by Professor Norman Ramsey

Born from a seminar on advanced topics in functional programming at 
Tufts University, Improvise is a project that set out to explore a new method of 
algorithmic music composition.  Improvise uses ideas from game theory and a 
mathematical model for how human musicians improvise to algorithmically generate 
music that resembles human improvisation.

#####*A Model of Performance, Interaction,and Improvisation*

This is the main paper we are working from. A pdf version can be found [here](http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/interaction.pdf).


#####*Domain-Specific Language Support for Experimental Game Theory*

Introduces Hagl, a domain-specific embedded language for experimental game
theory. The code and more information can be found [here](https://github.com/walkie/Hagl).

To even begin to make the code run, you need to install Euterpea and Hagl:

1. Download and install Euterpea, a domain-specific embedded language for 
computer music development.
