need to:
figure out how to represent a score in hagl

each note is an iterated game -- with an eye to past AND future games
same matrix each matrix of a single game
different matrix on your next note

each move is following the score, maybe making minor adjustments


each game is an eigth note
you choose to extend your previous move, rest, or make a new move
