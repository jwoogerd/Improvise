We are developing a tool to generate embellishments of simple scores.

We provide a base set of definitions in a number of categories:
aesthetic of music
value of contribution to a score
strategy for playing a music based game
depth of what to consider in that game
resolution

We also allow people to write and use their own definitions in any of these categories

This will allow people to use computers to create many versions of the same piece of music, and possible generate new ideas for how to modify a piece of music.

Notes from meeting with NR 11/6

How will we evaluation whether the tool is good?
User studies?
Chord changes and melody
Current key and chord


As part of our evaluation:
    - look at criteria for ICFP experience reports (our experience as
      programmers)
    - what we accomplish in the domain?
        - two things to consider: quality of results and usability


-- Next steps --

What is the user experience going to look like?

What's happening behind the scenes?

Keep track of the state of the system and ask 
    1) how quickly and easily could we modify our system based on users' experience?
    2) how hard was it to please users?
    3) how nimble can we be in response user suggestions?
    
Then afterward, we write an experience report: reflecting on the hypothesis
that function programming makes it easier (or perhaps harder) to modify our
system.
