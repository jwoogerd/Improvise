We are developing a tool to generate embellishments of simple scores.

We provide a base set of definitions in a number of categories:
aesthetic of music
value of contribution to a score
strategy for playing a music based game
depth of what to consider in that game
resolution

We also allow people to write and use their own definitions in any of these categories

This will allow people to use computers to create many versions of the same piece of music, and possible generate new ideas for how to modify a piece of music.
